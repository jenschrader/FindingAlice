# Finding Alice

 *This is a proof of concept created in the fall of 2022 for SDEV 148 - Intro to Game Development.*
 

 *Developed with Pygame*
 
## Story
 
 *Alice's journey*
 
> Play as Alice in this 2D platformer as she navigates the treacherous spirit world and confronts her inner demons in order to reunite the fractured pieces of her soul. 

> Along the way, Alice will face off against her "shadow selves," manifestations of her darkest fears and desires, who will stop at nothing to keep her trapped in limbo.

> Only by facing these shadows head-on and reclaiming the lost pieces of her soul can she hope to find her way back to the world of the living.
